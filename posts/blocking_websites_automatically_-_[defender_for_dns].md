Your organisation has started to use Defender for DNS. Whilst the product is great, it won't block malicious traffic. It will only fire an alert in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

You'd like to add more automation to block traffic going to these sites once an alert has been generated and let a security team member know. 

What Azure services could you use to do this?
