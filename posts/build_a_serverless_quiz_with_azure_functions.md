For this project, you can create an Azure static website that loads a set of questions from table storage via an Azure function-hosted REST API. The user then can enter their answers and another REST API function can check them and provide a score.

Technologies:

* Azure Static Sites
* Azure functions 
* Table storage

You can create the azure functions in a range of languages (C#, Powershell, Python, Java, Javascript and more) so there are many options.

As an extension, you could store the score and keep a scoreboard.
