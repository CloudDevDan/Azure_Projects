[Azure Pirate](https://twitter.com/azure_pirate) is a Twitter bot backed by PaaS services in Azure. In a nutshell, it parses multiple RSS feeds from members of the Azure community, and every time a new article (or YouTube video) is released, a Tweet is sent out announcing the release (in a silly pirate voice!).

Your brief with this project is to re-produce Azure Pirate!

Using any resource you feel right, regularly parse **more than one** RSS feed, and do something fun/creative with the results. Report back in the comments on what you've built.

The learning objectives here can be anything you want them to be. You could try new resources or tools that you're not familiar with, and make this as simple or advanced as you like.

Have fun!
