A fun project involving Azure Active Directory could be building a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for multiple web applications. With Azure Active Directory, you can set up SSO for multiple web apps using a centralised identity store, reducing the need for users to remember multiple sets of login credentials.

You could build a custom solution that integrates with multiple web applications (such as a shopping cart, a blog, a to-do list, etc.) and use Azure Active Directory as the identity provider. Users would be able to log in once and be automatically signed in to all applications, providing a seamless and convenient experience. Additionally, you could use Azure AD to enforce multifactor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to your solution.

You could also utilize Azure AD's Graph API to access user information, such as profile data, and use it to personalize the experience for users across all integrated applications. 

You could use Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline to continuously deploy and test updates to the solution.
