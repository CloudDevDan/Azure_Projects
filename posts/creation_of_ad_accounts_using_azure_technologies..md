Your organisation has a requirement to create AD users on-premises utilising Azure technologies. How could you go about using Azure for this?

\- You need to record the details of each user created. Timestamps, Firstname, Lastname and email address. This needs to be stored and retained somewhere.

\- An email must be sent to the reporting manager stating that the user account has been created.

\- You need to utilise Azure Monitor for alerts and notifications. Ensuring that you can monitor failures of account creation, etc.

What services in Azure could you use to do this?
