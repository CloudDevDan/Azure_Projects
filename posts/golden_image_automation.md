You deploy virtual machines regularly but notice that you are installing the same software over and over again, as well as patching the operating system.

Why not create a golden image? Better yet, build an automated method to maintain your golden image once it’s created.

You will need to:

- Create an image of a virtual machine

- Identify an approach to patch the image with the latest updates

- Automate the process to do this regularly

Want more? Have you:

- Put in alerts if the image was successfully patched

- Output a report of what updates have been applied

- Automate multiple image updates using a single process
