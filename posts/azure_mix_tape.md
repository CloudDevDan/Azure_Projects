Create a Azure media services solution where you make sure some (royalte free) songs are available for streaming.  
Create a front end (static) web app which uses the azure media player and picks a random song every X seconds (I would suggest 15 second because of copyright laws) to play. Have the player auto start.  
For bonus points you can create a pauze and resume option.  
For more bonus points you can make it a progressive web app which can also be installed as an app.  
For even more bonus points you can create a upload function where people can upload music to the solution to be added to the randomizer.
