# APIM authentication for Azure Functions

Here's one idea:

You could build a serverless image-processing API that uses Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions. The API could allow users to upload an image and apply various image processing functions to it, such as resizing, adding filters, and converting to different image formats.

APIM would handle authentication and manage the API endpoints, while Azure Functions would perform the image processing tasks. The Functions could be written in a language such as Python or JavaScript, and they would use libraries such as Pillow to perform the actual image processing.

The processed images could be stored in Azure Blob storage and served through the API using APIM. To ensure scalability and reliability, you could use Azure Functions to process images in parallel and leverage the APIM caching feature to cache frequently requested images.

This project would give you the opportunity to learn about serverless computing, API development, and image processing, and it could have real-world applications in areas such as web development and mobile app development.

The focus of this project should be around APIM handling the authentication for Azure Functions. You can use any idea for the Functions component, the image-processing is simply a suggestion.
