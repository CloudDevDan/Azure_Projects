Azure policy is a great tool to ensure constancy across your tenant. It can block users but also automate processes and remidation.

In this project, you will create an Azure policy to:  


1. Restrict Azure regions resources can be deployed to
2. Enforce a naming convention for resource groups with a deny custom policy 
3. Use a policy to add a  tag to help if they have not been added taking the values from the parent resource group

To take this further you can create these using Bicep.
