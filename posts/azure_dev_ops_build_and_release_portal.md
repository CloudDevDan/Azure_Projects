You use Azure Dev Ops to build and deploy a range of different projects. You want to be able to see at glance what is currently building.

By making use of the API available for Azure DevOps build a dashboard to display what is currently building or deploying. 

When I attempted this I made use of dotnet and Blazor to build a Web app, however there are lots of options available so have some fun and see what you can build. What other API endpoints are available? Can you view extra information about a build? Can you queue off a new build? Is it possible to do something similar for github actions?
