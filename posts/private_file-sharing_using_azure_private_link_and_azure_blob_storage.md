Try building a private file-sharing service using Azure Private Link and Azure Blob storage. The service would allow users to securely upload and download files from a private network without exposing their data to the public internet.

The service could be built using Azure Blob storage as the backend storage, and Azure Private Link could be used to create a private endpoint for the Blob storage. This would allow the service to securely connect to the Blob storage over a private network connection, ensuring that data is kept confidential and secure.

For the frontend, you could build a simple web application or a mobile app that allows users to upload and download files to and from the Blob storage. 

To secure the data, you could encrypt the data both at rest and in transit using Azure Blob storage's built-in encryption features, as well as SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit. Additionally, you could use Azure Active Directory to authenticate and authorize users, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the files.
