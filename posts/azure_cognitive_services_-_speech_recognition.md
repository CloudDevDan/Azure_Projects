Here's a fun project idea involving Azure Cognitive Services:

Create a Dictaphone application, running in Azure!

Press a button and talk into a microphone, having Azure Cognitive Services transcribe the audio to text in real-time. Press a button to stop recording, then have the transcription saved to either a database or blob storage (for example) for later reference.

As an added (and extra fun) challenge, create a keyword recognition model so that saying a specific word (such as Pineapple!) automatically starts/stops the transcription.

Have fun with this one!
