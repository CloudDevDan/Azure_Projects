# AZURE PROJECTS

![AZURE PROJECTS](banner.png 'AZURE PROJECTS')

Following on from the success of [Azure Pirate](https://clouddevdan.co.uk/azure-pirate), I've been busy working behind the scenes to launch a new Azure community initiative, called AZURE PROJECTS!

## What is it?

Azure Projects is a community initiative to facilitate a "learn by doing" approach to Microsoft Azure and related technologies.

Here's the concept: you've been upskilling in an area of Azure and are ready to have a go yourself, but need a little inspiration on what to try.

This is where Azure Projects comes in!

For more information, please view my blog post, [here](https://clouddevdan.co.uk/azure-projects).

**Note that this GitHub repository has replaced the subreddit.**

**The project has been archived as of April 2023.**
